If you’ve got a Mac, it only takes a few seconds
If you don’t already have it, install Homebrew by opening up terminal and running: $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
Install gdal with the command: $ brew install gdal
Grab a Shapefile (distributed as a .zip file) from the DC Data Catalog or your favorite data source and unzip it someplace convenient
cd into the directory with your shiny new unzipped Shapefile
Run (replacing [name] with the name of your downloaded Shapefile): $ ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON -t_srs crs:84 [name].geojson [name].shp
Grab the resulting GeoJSON file and commit it to GitHub
Navigate to the GeoJSON file on GitHub.com to browse your map
In addition to converting the Shapefile over to GeoJSON, the other step in there, -t_srs crs:84, ensures that by the time the data hits GitHub, it’s encoded with the right projection so it can be mapped properly. Need to convert multiple Shapefiles in bulk? Just use this bulk Shapefile to GeoJSON conversion script. Windows users? You’re covered too.

Note: The same process should work for KML files as well, replacing [name].shp with [name].kml.
